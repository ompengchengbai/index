Welcome to my site! My name is Pengcheng Bai( 柏, 鹏程 in Chinese, prounced like "Punch on Buy" or "Bag" for short). I am now a first year PhD student in Operations Management in Lee Kong Chian Business School at Singapore Management University(SMU). Previously, I got my master degree at Nanjing University. 

My research interests include the state-of-art operations research techonology and analytical modeling as well as their applications in operations management. Besides topics in operations management, I am also working on the topics in microeconomics, such as information design and contest theory.
